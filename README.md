Aims;
-NFT ownership determines issuance of JWT controlling session time/duration
-Separation of browser-based wallet interactions and JSON-RPC calls
-Create a websocket connection from backend to blockchain for notification of

-Meta transactions
-ZKPs
-Base64 encoding (immutable, key-value) and proxy pattern in Solidity
